    <body> The Brunswick I-Jet lab has been given the responsibility of developing this year’s <b>exhibit for the annual Consumer Electronics Show held in Las Vegas</b>. 
        The goal is for the exhibit to showcase the future of Brunswick technology and provide attendees with an interactive experience by developing an <b>Augmented Reality (AR) boating experience simulation. </b></body> <br>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <span style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 23px;">Breakdown</span> <br>
    <body>  My role as the visual design intern entails designing screens and interactive design for the <i>Multi Functional Display (MFD)</i> and AR elements while collaborating with the CGI team tasked with creating the simulation. </body>
      <body>    1. Conceptualize and design MFD screens for every phase of the simulation </body> <br>
      <body>    2. Design AR elements including information cards that would be viewed in the simulation </body> <br>
      <body>    3. Devise user journeys and storyboards for every phase of the simulation </body><br>
  </div><br><br>

    <span style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 23px;">The Process</span> <br>
    <i><span style="font-size: 18px;">Part 1: Wireframing and Sketching</span></i> <br>
      <body> 
        Since I joined the project about a month in, I caught up on what had been done thus far and was ready to jump into mocking up some preliminary designs of the MFD. 
        We started off with sketching different formats of vehicle dashboards and what potential features could be included. 
      </body><br>

  <div>
    <i><span style="font-size: 18px;">Part 2: Design Sprint 1</span></i> <br>
      <body>
        During this phase of the project, our team designed iterations of the SPOTLITE site and recieved feedback at weekly meetings with Cline stakeholders and over Microsoft Teams for more rapid feedback. 
        The Cline Center website is hosted through the Illinois Drupal framework so as a result, we determined that we wanted to match the design of this framework but wanted to differentiate it for it to look like a standalone site.  
      </body><br>
      <body>
        With iterations being made for the dashboard as well as website design, we began conducting user interviews. In order to gauge the effectivity of the dashboard, we interviewed 8 Cline student analysts with this general interview guide. 
        We recieved constructive feedback and were able to apply changes accordingly. 
        Although we weren’t able to conduct user interviews with those outside of Cline, we found these interviews to be invaluable in making the dashboard better. 
      </body><br>

  <div>
    <i><span style="font-size: 18px;">Part 3: Design Sprint 2</span></i> <br>
    <body>
      During this phase, we began reaching a final design for the dashboard and website design through more iterations and feedback sessions. As a result, we began implementing the design in Drupal. 
    </body>
    <body>
      Here is the Figma file we used to explore different designs for the SPOTLITE site:

    <span style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 23px;">Personal Takeaways</span> <br>
    <body> 
        This was a very high paced project with a quick turn around time due to a concrete deadline. Taking in the role of project lead allowed me to explore how to grapple with uncertainty as well as improve my communication skills in order to 
        get on the same page as the client.<br></body>
    <body>
      This project required for me to use the content management tool, Drupal, that I was unfamiliar with so there was a learning curve when it came to implementing the final figma design. 
      In the end, with the help of a Cline researcher, we were able to finish the site in time and I learned how to navigate the tool.

    <span style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 23px;">Launch Day</span> <br>
      <body>
        On October 7, the SPOTLITE site was launched by the Cline Center at the Chancellor’s “Call To Action” symposium at UIUC. 
        The SPOTLITE team at Cline had been collecting the data that went into this dashboard since 2017 and were able to successfully launch the database to the public.
